# Web Scraper with GitHub Recording

This Python script is designed to scrape a webpage at regular intervals, detect changes, and record them on GitHub. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for web scraping and PyGithub for GitHub interactions.

## Features

- Web scraping to extract data from a specified webpage.
- GitHub integration to record changes in a designated repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3
2. Required Python packages: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `PyGithub`

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 PyGithub
```

### GitHub Setup

1. Create a GitHub repository to store the recorded data.
2. Generate a personal access token on GitHub with the necessary permissions (repo).
3. Replace the placeholder values in the script with your GitHub token, repository name, and file path.

```python
github_token = 'your_github_token'
repo_name = 'your_repo_name'
file_path = 'path/to/recorded_data.txt'
```

## Usage

1. Run the script using:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

2. The script will scrape the specified webpage, compare the data with the existing content on GitHub, and record changes if detected.

3. The script runs in a loop, executing every 5 hours. Adjust the sleep duration in the script if needed.
